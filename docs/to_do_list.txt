To Do:
    improve print outs for various interactions
    appease the linter
    check out input arg validation, seems to return blank when should not at times


Later:
    log text doesn't always wrap
    test and make work on linux
    mention it works best on windows terminal in readme


If Possible:
    set terminal font size (8)
    auto hide default scroll bar in terminal
    remember scrollbar placement for when the app is scrunched


Maybes:
    close game/pluto instances button
    pluto ascii art
    current players in game, similar to their discord command for it
