### App Details:
- **Made for Windows Terminal**: The app is designed for Windows Terminal but also works in the standard command prompt.
- **Font Size**: Designed for font size **8**. Future versions will adjust the font size automatically.
- **Platform Support**: Currently tested on **Windows**, with future plans for atleast modern Ubuntu and Debian Linux installs.
- **Other**: Currently only supports Plutonium's **LAN** mode, if possible, I will change this in the future. Currently token generation is all that is left to do this.
